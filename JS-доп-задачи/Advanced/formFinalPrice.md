# Form final price
You need to show a price with a discount. Your function given a number should return a formed price that starts with the dollar symbol and final price. Final price equals to price minus 25% discount (but discount can't be bigger than $20). Final price should be formed in Dollar.Cent format. Invalid arguments should result in returned value to be false.

For example, given `10`, your function needs to return `$7.50`.
