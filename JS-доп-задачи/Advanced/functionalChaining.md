# Functional chaining
 Create functions `plus` and `minus` that can be chained. The first function in the chain should add or subtract provided value from 0. All other functions should add or subtract from the result of the previous function in the chain. At the end of the chain field `result` should contain the final value of functional chain calculations.
Chain may be of any depth.

For example: `plus(20).minus(1).plus(6).result` should be equal to 25

```
function plus(val, origin) {
    // write your code here
}

function minus(val, origin) {
   // write your code here
}
```
