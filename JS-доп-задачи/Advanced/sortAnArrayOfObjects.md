# Sort an array of objects
 Having an array of objects that have value age, write a function that will sort this array based on the age field (from lowest to highest) and will return the sorted array. You need to sort using compare function.

For example, given following code:

`var users = [`
`  {name: "Mike", age: 25},`
`  {name: "Jhon", age: 20},`
`  {name: "Dan", age: 22}`
`];`

`var result = sortByAge(users);`

`result` will be equal to

`[`
`  {name: "Jhon", age: 20},`
`  {name: "Dan", age: 22},`
`  {name: "Mike", age: 25}`
`];`

```
function sortByAge(arr) {
   // write your code here
}
```
