# Capitalised Names

When secretary added new Users to our list of students, capslock was broken, so now all names start with a lowercase first letter;
You need to write a function and return `new array` with all names inside it starting with the first symbol in an upperCase.

```
function makeFirstSymbolUpperCase (arrayList) {
   // write your code here
}
```
