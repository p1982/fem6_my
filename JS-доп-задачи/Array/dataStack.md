# Data Stack
 Given an array that represents a stack of some data with the limited amount of data in it, write a function that will add to the end of the array new value and at the same time will remove the first item in an array, so that total length of the array will remain the same.

For example, `addToStack([1, 2, 3],  4)` should return `[2, 3, 4]`;

```
function addToStack(arr, item) {
    // write your code here
}
```
