# Find an object in the array
 Given an array of objects containing field `id`, write a function that will receive as arguments such array and an id value. Using modern Array methods, this function should find one element whose id is identical to the provided one as the argument and return the found object.

```
function findUser(arr, id) {
    // write your code here
}
```
