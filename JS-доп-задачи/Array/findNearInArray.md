# Find near in array
 Write a function that will receive an array of numbers and a number. Return true if the array contains the number with +/- 1 accuracy. I.e. 3 will be true for range from 2 to 4.

For example, `containsNear([1, 2, 3], 4)` will return `true`.

```
function containsNear(arr, val) {
   // write your code here
}
```
