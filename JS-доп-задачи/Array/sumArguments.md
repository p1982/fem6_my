# Sum of arguments

There is a `sum` function that should return the sum of all the arguments given to it, but there is a problem that the number of arguments can be from` 2` to `20`, we don't know exactly how many arguments will be.

Restriction: You need to write code in a functional way, without `for-loops`

```
function sum() {
   // write your code here
}
```
