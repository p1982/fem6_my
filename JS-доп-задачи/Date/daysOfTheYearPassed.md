# Days of the year passed
 Write a function that will receive a date object and will return how many full days have passed since the beginning of the current year.

For example, `fullDaysPassed( new Date("1/20/2018"))` must return `19`.

```
function fullDaysPassed(date) {
  // write your code here
}
```
