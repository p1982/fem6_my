# Days passed
 Write a function that will receive as arguments two objects - date1 and date2. Calculate how many days have passed from date1 to date2.

For example, `daysPassed(new Date("2/20/2018"), new Date("11/1/2018"))` will return `254`.

```
function daysPassed(date1, date2) {
   // write your code here
}
```
