# Show time
 Write a function that will receive as argument one number which is a Unix timestamp. Based on this timestamp function should return a string value in the format of `HH:MM:SS` of time set in this timestamp. If an hour, minute or second is less than 10 - add null before it (so that `2` displayed as `02`).

Example of such string - `05:04:01`.

```
function showTime(timestamp) {
   // write your code here
}
```
