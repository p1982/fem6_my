# Copy properties
 Create a function that will receive links to two objects as arguments. Copy properties from the second object to the first one. Make a simple copy, no recursion required.

For example, given `objA = {a: 1}` and `objB = {b: 2}` calling `copyProperties(objA, objB)` will pollute objA and it will be equal to `{a: 1, b: 2}`.

```
function copyProperties(objA, objB) {
   // write your code here
}
```
