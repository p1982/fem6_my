# Delete property
 Write a function that will receive an object and a name of the property as a string. Delete the selected property from the object and return it.

For exmaple, having object `obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}` calling `deleteProperty(obj, "b")` will return `{a: 1, c: 3}`.

```
function deleteProperty(obj, field) {
    // write your code here
}
```
