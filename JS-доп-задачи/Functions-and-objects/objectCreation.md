# Object creation

You need to create an object using function-constructor.
The object must have `string` fields `model` and `type`.
The object must have `boolean` fields `isActive`, its default value must be `false`.
Values of `type`, `model` and `isActive` must be received from the constructor arguments.

example of the constructed object:
`{`
`  type: "car",`
`  model: "bmv",`
`  isActive: false`
`}`
