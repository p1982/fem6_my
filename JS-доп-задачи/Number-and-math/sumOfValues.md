# Sum of values in an array
 Given an array of mixed values, write a function that will accept such array as an argument and will return a sum of all numeric values in the array. If a string contains number - it must be cast to it and calculated as well. Non-number values and string that can't be cast to a number must be ignored.

For example, `sumNumbers([1, "2", "abc", 3])` must return number `6`.

```
function sumNumbers(input){
  // write your code here
}
```
