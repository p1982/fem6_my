# Search and modify characters in a string
 Write a function that will receive a string and a character as arguments. Search string for all occurrences of provided character and capitalize it.

For example, `showCharacter("abc", "b")` should return `"aBc"`.

```
function showCharacter(str, chr) {
   // write your code here
}
```
